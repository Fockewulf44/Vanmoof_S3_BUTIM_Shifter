Parts you need
--------

* **3D printed parts**: Top, Bottom, Intermediate gear, Helical gear, Involute Rack(cable shifter)
  </br>
  </br>
  Printing settings:
  </br>
  Material: **PLA or PETG**
  </br>
  Infill: for Top and Bottom case **15%** or **20%**; for gears I would recommend at least **60%**

  <img src= "/Images/Top_Internal_v_1_2.jpg" width = "400" />
* **Shimano Gear shifter** like 4 or 6 speed. Cable must travel **2.8mm** on each gear shift. Shimano 7 speed has a shorter cable travel, so it won't work.

Assembling
----------

</br>
1. **M7 Brake Lever Adjuster**
2. **Cable Shifter**
3. **Intermediate gear**
4. **Helical gear**
5. **Spring with diameter 9mm**
6. **Spring with diameter 5mm**

**Instruction:**
</br>
Before assembling, make sure that you put enough of silicone grease. It will make shifting way smoother. After assembling add more grease.
</br>
The helical gear has a dot that indicates the current gear. Each gear corresponds to 30 degrees of rotation, so moving from first gear to fourth gear requires a total rotation of 90 degrees. Adjust Cable shifter(Involute Rack) that way that switching from first gear to fourth gear is within the range.
